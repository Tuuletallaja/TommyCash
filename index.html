                    Cash was born as Tomas Tammemets in Tallinn and is of mixed ethnic Estonian, Russian, Ukrainian, and Kazakh origin. He has described himself as first and foremost an Estonian, then Eastern European in his soul, and Scandinavian in a CV. Cash was raised in a one-room flat in the Kopli subdistrict of Tallinn, that was not far from a soup kitchen; Kopli is primarily a lower-class neighbourhood populated by ethnic Russians.

            <p class="hero-text-even-bigger">
                In his youth, Cash was a graffiti artist who was often running from the police, sometimes being caught and arrested for vandalism. Cash performed "rather well" in school until age 15, when he began smoking cannabis. He has stated that his drug use led him to be "ejected" from schooling. He never graduated from secondary school, despite sitting for exams, and later took up painting and dancing in place of academics.
