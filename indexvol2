                    It’s me, but I don’t know it’s me. The only reason I know it’s me is because I see pictures. It’s kind of like an alter-ego thing or a side-effect of huffing propane.

                    I swear I could spot a junkie from a kilometre and tell you exactly what drug he was on."

In his youth, Cash was a graffiti artist who was often running from the police, sometimes being caught and arrested for vandalism.[6][7] Cash performed "rather well" in school until age 15, when he began smoking cannabis. He has stated that his drug use led him to be "ejected" from schooling.[3] He never graduated from secondary school, despite sitting for exams, and later took up painting and dancing in place of academics.[
