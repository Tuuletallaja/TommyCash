                    Terror Reid is an American rapper from San Jose, California.

                    In his interview with Daily Beat,Getter,explained that Terror Reid is his hip hop alter-ego:
                    
                    I’m Terror Reid! I put on a ski mask, and I rap. Basically what I do is I huff propane to get high as f*, put on a ski mask, and then I get blacked out and rap for an hour.
                </p>
                <p class="hero-text-bigger">
                    It’s me, but I don’t know it’s me. The only reason I know it’s me is because I see pictures. It’s kind of like an alter-ego thing or a side-effect of huffing propane.
