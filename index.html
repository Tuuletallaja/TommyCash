                    Cash was born as Tomas Tammemets in Tallinn and is of mixed ethnic Estonian, Russian, Ukrainian, and Kazakh origin. He has described himself as first and foremost an Estonian, then Eastern European in his soul, and Scandinavian in a CV. Cash was raised in a one-room flat in the Kopli subdistrict of Tallinn, that was not far from a soup kitchen; Kopli is primarily a lower-class neighbourhood populated by ethnic Russians.

                Everyone in Europe seems to know Tommy Cash, within a few degrees of separation. When I started talking about interviewing him a couple of years ago, every Estonian I met would tell me a story about running into the rapper at a party. I thought that was weird but not impossible—Estonia, after all, is a country of only 1.37 million. Then I got to talking with a barman in a central London chain pub. “Oh, Tommy,” he said, “I got high with him once.” The barman has never been to Estonia in his life. Of course, any (or all) of these people could be lying, but it's easier to entertain the idea of Cash casting a web in the night, the only common denominator among perfect strangers.
