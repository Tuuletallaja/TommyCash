            <p class="hero-text">Terror Reid's latest single, "When It's All Gone! (What You Believe In?)," was just released. It showcases his skill as both a producer and lyricist. This latest work has a very boom bap hip-hop feel to it, giving it an old school underground quality. The production is done by Petulla himself, showing his breadth of ability as a producer - but the lyric writing and flow is just as impressive. <img src="https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/spotify-logo-png/file-spotify-logo-png-4.png" width="50" height="50" alt="Italian Trulli"> </p>

                    Terror Reid is an American rapper from San Jose, California.

                    In his interview with Daily Beat,Getter,explained that Terror Reid is his hip hop alter-ego:
                    
                    I’m Terror Reid! I put on a ski mask, and I rap. Basically what I do is I huff propane to get high as f*, put on a ski mask, and then I get blacked out and rap for an hour.
                </p>
                <p class="hero-text-bigger">
                    It’s me, but I don’t know it’s me. The only reason I know it’s me is because I see pictures. It’s kind of like an alter-ego thing or a side-effect of huffing propane.
