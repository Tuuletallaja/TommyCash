                    It’s me, but I don’t know it’s me. The only reason I know it’s me is because I see pictures. It’s kind of like an alter-ego thing or a side-effect of huffing propane.

                    Cash was born as Tomas Tammemets in Tallinn and is of mixed ethnic Estonian, Russian, Ukrainian, and Kazakh origin. He has described himself as first and foremost an Estonian, then Eastern European in his soul, and Scandinavian in a CV. Cash was raised in a one-room flat in the Kopli subdistrict of Tallinn, that was not far from a soup kitchen; Kopli is primarily a lower-class neighbourhood populated by ethnic Russians.
